<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>Biography of<br /><span class="small">THOMAS A. WATSON</span></i></span></h2>
<p>Thomas A. Watson was born on January 18, 1854, in
Salem, Massachusetts, and died December 13, 1934, at
more than four-score years. At the age of 13 he left school
and went to work in a store. Always keenly interested in
learning more and in making the most of all he learned,
every new experience was to him, from his childhood on,
an opening door into a larger, more beautiful and more
wonderful world. This was the key to the continuous
variety that gave interest to his life.</p>
<p>In 1874 he obtained employment in the electrical shop
of Charles Williams, Jr., at 109 Court Street, Boston.
Here he met Alexander Graham Bell, and the telephone
chapter in his life began. This he has told in the little
book herewith presented. In 1881, having well earned a
rest from the unceasing struggle with the problems of
early telephony, and being now a man of means, he resigned
his position in the American Bell Telephone Company
and spent a year in Europe. On his return he
started a little machine shop for his own pleasure, at his
place in East Braintree, Massachusetts. From this grew
the Fore River Ship and Engine Company, which did its
large share of building the U. S. Navy of the Spanish
War. In 1904 he retired from active business.</p>
<p>When 40 years of age and widely known as a shipbuilder,
he went to college, taking special courses in
geology and biology at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. At the same time he specialized in literature.
These studies dominated his later years, leading him
in extensive travels all over the world, and at home
extending to others the inspiration of a genial simplicity
of life and of a love for science, literature and all that
is fine in life.</p>

<h1 title="">The Birth and Babyhood of the Telephone</h1>
<p class="tbcenter"><i>By</i> <span class="sc">Thomas A. Watson</span></p>
<p>I am to speak to you of the birth and babyhood of the telephone,
and something of the events which preceded that important occasion.
These are matters that must seem to you ancient history;
in fact, they seem so to me, although the events all happened less
than 40 years ago, in the years 1874 to 1880.</p>
<p>The occurrences of which I shall speak, lie in my mind as a splendid
drama, in which it was my great privilege to play a part. I shall
try to put myself back into that wonderful play, and tell you its
story from the same attitude of mind I had then&mdash;the point of view
of a mere boy, just out of his apprenticeship as an electro-mechanician,
intensely interested in his work, and full of boyish hope and
enthusiasm. Therefore, as it must be largely a personal narrative,
I shall ask you to excuse my many &ldquo;I&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;my&rsquo;s&rdquo; and to be indulgent
if I show how proud and glad I am that I was chosen by the
fates to be the associate of Alexander Graham Bell, to work side by
side with him day and night through all these wonderful happenings
that have meant so much to the world.</p>
<h3 id="c2">The Williams&rsquo; Electrical Workshop</h3>
<p>I realize now what a lucky boy I was, when at 13 years of age I
had to leave school and go to work for my living, although I didn&rsquo;t
think so at that time. I am not advising my young friends to leave
school at this age, for they may not have the opportunity to enter
college as I did at 40. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;tide in the affairs of men,&rdquo; you
know, and that was the beginning of its flood in my life, for after
trying several vocations&mdash;clerking, bookkeeping, carpentering, etc.&mdash;and
finding them all unattractive, I at last found just the job that
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
suited me in the electrical work-shop
of Charles Williams, at 109
Court Street, Boston&mdash;one of the
best men I have ever known. Better
luck couldn&rsquo;t befall a boy than
to be brought so early in life under
the influence of such a high-minded
gentleman as Charles Williams.</p>
<p>I want to say a few words about
my work there, not only to give
you a picture of such a shop in the
early &rsquo;70s, but also because in this
shop the telephone had its birth
and a good deal of its early
development.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Thomas A. Watson in 1874</i></p>
</div>
<p>I was first set to work on a hand
lathe turning binding posts for $5
a week. The mechanics of to-day
with their automatic screw machines,
hardly know what it is to turn little rough castings with a
hand tool. How the hot chips used to fly into our eyes! One day I had
a fine idea. I bought a pair of 25-cent goggles, thinking the others
would hail me as a benefactor of mankind and adopt my plan. But
they laughed at me for being such a sissy boy and public opinion
forced me back to the old time-honored plan of winking when I saw a
chip coming. It was not an efficient plan, for the chip usually got there
first. There was a liberal education in it for me in manual dexterity.
There was no specializing in these shops at that time. Each workman
built everything there was in the shop to build, and an apprentice
also had a great variety of jobs, which kept him interested all
the time, for his tools were poor and simple and it required lots of
thought to get a job done right.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Studies and Experiments</h3>
<p>There were few books on electricity published at that time.
Williams had copies of most of them in his showcase, which we boys
used to read noons, but the book that interested me most was Davis&rsquo;
Manual of Magnetism, published in 1847, a copy of which I made
mine for 25 cents. If you want to get a good idea of the state of
the electrical art at that time, you should read that book. I found it
very stimulating and that same old copy in all the dignity of its
dilapidation has a place of honor on my book shelves to-day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>My promotion to higher work
was rapid. Before two years had
passed, I had tried my skill on
about all the regular work of the
establishment&mdash;call bells, annunciators,
galvanometers, telegraph
keys, sounders, relays, registers and
printing telegraph instruments.</p>
<p>Individual initiative was the
rule in Williams&rsquo; shop&mdash;we all did
about as we pleased. Once I built
a small steam engine for myself
during working hours, when business
was slack. No one objected.
That steam engine, by the way,
was the embryo of the biggest
shipbuilding plant in the United
States to-day, which I established
some ten years later with telephone
profits, and which now
employs more than 4,000 men.</p>

<p>Such were the electrical shops of that day. Crude and small as they
were, they were the forerunners of the great electrical works of
to-day. In them were being trained the men who were among the
leaders in the wonderful development of applied electricity which
began soon after the time of which I am to speak. Williams, although
he never had at that time more than 30 or 40 men working for him,
had one of the largest and best fitted shops in the country. I think
the Western Electric shop at Chicago was the only larger one. That
was also undoubtedly better organized and did better work than
Williams&rsquo;. When a piece of machinery built by the Western Electric
came into our shop for repairs, we boys always used to admire the
superlative excellence of the workmanship.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Experience with Inventors</h3>
<p>Besides the regular work at Williams&rsquo;, there was a constant stream
of wild-eyed inventors, with big ideas in their heads and little money
in their pockets, coming to the shop to have their ideas tried out in
brass and iron. Most of them had an &ldquo;angel&rdquo; whom they had
hypnotized into paying the bills. My enthusiasm, and perhaps my
sympathetic nature, made me a favorite workman with those men of
visions, and in 1873-74 my work had become largely making
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
experimental apparatus for such
men. Few of their ideas ever
amounted to anything, but I
liked to do the work, as it kept
me roaming in fresh fields and
pastures new all the time. Had
it not been, however, for my
youthful enthusiasm&mdash;always one
of my chief assets&mdash;I fear this
experience would have made me
so skeptical and cynical as to the
value of electrical inventions that
my future prospects might have
been injured.</p>

</div>
<p>I remember one limber-tongued
patriarch who had induced some
men to subscribe $1,000 to build
what he claimed to be an entirely
new electric engine. I had made
much of it for him. There was
nothing new in the engine, but he
intended to generate his electric
current in a series of iron tanks
the size of trunks, to be filled with nitric acid with the usual zinc
plates suspended therein. When the engine was finished and the acid
poured into the tanks for the first time, no one waited to see the
engine run, for inventor, &ldquo;angel,&rdquo; and workmen all tried to see who
could get out of the shop quickest. I won the race as I had the best start.</p>
<p>I suppose there is just such a crowd of crude minds still besieging
the work-shops, men who seem incapable of finding out what has
been already done, and so keep on, year after year, threshing old straw.</p>
<h3 id="c5">The &ldquo;Harmonic Telegraph&rdquo;</h3>
<p>All the men I worked for at that time were not of that type. There
were a few very different. Among them, dear old Moses G. Farmer,
perhaps the leading practical electrician of that day. He was full of
good ideas, which he was constantly bringing to Williams to have
worked out. I did much of his work and learned from him more about
electricity than ever before or since. He was electrician at that time
for the United States Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island,
and in the early winter of 1874 I was making for him some experimental
torpedo exploding apparatus. That apparatus will always be
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
connected in my mind with the telephone, for one day when I was
hard at work on it, a tall, slender, quick-motioned man with pale face,
black side whiskers, and drooping mustache, big nose and high sloping
forehead crowned with bushy, jet black hair, came rushing out of the
office and over to my work bench. It was Alexander Graham Bell,
whom I saw then for the first time. He was bringing to me a piece
of mechanism which I had made for him under instructions from the
office. It had not been made as he had directed and he had broken
down the rudimentary discipline of the shop in coming directly to me
to get it altered. It was a receiver and a transmitter of his &ldquo;Harmonic
Telegraph,&rdquo; an invention of his with which he was then endeavoring
to win fame and fortune. It was a simple affair by means of which,
utilizing the law of sympathetic vibration, he expected to send six
or eight Morse messages on a single wire at the same time, without
interference.</p>

</div>
<p>Although most of you are probably familiar with the device, I must,
to make my story clear, give you a brief description of the instruments,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
for though Bell never succeeded
in perfecting his telegraph, his
experimenting on it led to a discovery
of the highest importance.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">

<p class="pcap"><i>The Birthplace of the Telephone,
109 Court Street, Boston.&mdash;On the top
floor of this building, in 1875, Prof.
Bell carried on his experiments and
first succeeded in transmitting speech
by electricity</i></p>
</div>
<p>The essential parts of both
transmitter and receiver were an
electro-magnet and a flattened
piece of steel clock spring. The
spring was clamped by one end to
one pole of the magnet, and had
its other end free to vibrate over
the other pole. The transmitter
had, besides this, make-and-break
points like an ordinary vibrating
bell which, when the current was
on, kept the spring vibrating in a
sort of nasal whine, of a pitch
corresponding to the pitch of the
spring. When the signalling key
was closed, an electrical copy of
that whine passed through the
wire and the distant receiver.
There were, say, six transmitters
with their springs tuned to six
different pitches and six receivers
with their springs tuned to correspond.
Now, theoretically, when a
transmitter sent its electrical
whine into the line wire, its own
faithful receiver spring at the distant station would wriggle sympathetically
but all the others on the same line would remain coldly
quiescent. Even when all the transmitters were whining at once
through their entire gamut, making a row as if all the miseries this
world of trouble ever produced were concentrated there, each receiver
spring along the line would select its own from that sea of troubles
and ignore all the others. Just see what a simple, sure-to-work invention
this was; for just break up those various whines into the dots and
dashes of Morse messages and one wire would do the work of six, and
the &ldquo;Duplex&rdquo; telegraph that had just been invented would be beaten to
a frazzle. Bell&rsquo;s reward would be immediate and rich, for the &ldquo;Duplex&rdquo;
had been bought by the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
giving them a great advantage over their only competitor, the Western
Union Company, and the latter would, of course, buy Bell&rsquo;s
invention and his financial problems would be solved.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The Garret, 109 Court St., Boston, where Bell Verified the Principle of
Electrical Speech Transmission</i></p>
</div>
<p>All this was, as I have said, theoretical, and it was mighty lucky
for Graham Bell that it was, for had his harmonic telegraph been a
well behaved apparatus that always did what its parent wanted it to
do, the speaking telephone might never have emerged from a certain
marvelous conception, that had even then been surging back of Bell&rsquo;s
high forehead for two or three years. What that conception was, I
soon learned, for he couldn&rsquo;t help speaking about it, although his
friends tried to hush it up. They didn&rsquo;t like to have him get the reputation
of being visionary, or&mdash;something worse.</p>
<p>To go on with my story; after Mr. Farmer&rsquo;s peace-making machines
were finished, I made half a dozen pairs of the harmonic instruments
for Bell. He was surprised, when he tried them, to find that they
didn&rsquo;t work as well as he expected. The cynical Watson wasn&rsquo;t at all
surprised for he had never seen anything electrical yet that worked at
first the way the inventor thought it would. Bell wasn&rsquo;t discouraged in
the least and a long course of experiments followed which gave me a
steady job that winter and brought me into close contact with a
wonderful personality that did more to mould my life rightly than
anything else that ever came into it.</p>
<p>I became mightily tired of those &ldquo;whiners&rdquo; that winter. I called
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
them by that name, perhaps, as an inadequate expression of my
disgust with their persistent perversity, the struggle with which soon
began to take all the joy out of my young life, not being endowed
with the power of Macbeth&rsquo;s weird sisters to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Look into the seeds of time,</p>
<p class="t0">And say which grain will grow and which will not.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Let me say here, that I have always had a feeling of respect for
Elisha Gray, who, a few years later, made that harmonic telegraph
work, and vibrate well-behaved messages, that would go where they
were sent without fooling with every receiver on the line.</p>
<p>Most of Bell&rsquo;s early experimenting on the harmonic telegraph was
done in Salem, at the home of Mrs. George Sanders, where he resided
for several years, having charge of the instruction of her deaf
nephew. The present Y. M. C. A. building is on the site of that
house. I would occasionally work with Bell there, but most of his
experimenting in which I took part was done in Boston.</p>
<h3 id="c6">Bell&rsquo;s Theory of Transmitting Speech</h3>
<p>Mr. Bell was very apt to do his experimenting at night, for he was
busy during the day at the Boston University, where he was Professor
of Vocal Physiology, especially teaching his father&rsquo;s system of visible
speech, by which a deaf mute might learn to talk&mdash;quite significant
of what Bell was soon to do in making mute metal talk. For this
reason I would often remain at the shop during the evening to help
him test some improvement he had had me make on the instruments.</p>
<p>One evening when we were resting from our struggles with the
apparatus, Bell said to me: &ldquo;Watson, I want to tell you of another
idea I have, which I think will surprise you.&rdquo; I listened, I suspect,
somewhat languidly, for I must have been working that day about
sixteen hours, with only a short nutritive interval, and Bell had already
given me, during the weeks we had worked together, more new
ideas on a great variety of subjects, including visible speech, elocution
and flying machines, than my brain could assimilate, but when he went
on to say that he had an idea by which he believed it would be possible
to talk by telegraph, my nervous system got such a shock that the
tired feeling vanished. I have never forgotten his exact words; they
have run in my mind ever since like a mathematical formula. &ldquo;<i>If</i>,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;<i>I could make a current of electricity vary in intensity, precisely
as the air varies in density during the production of a sound, I should
be able to transmit speech telegraphically</i>.&rdquo; He then sketched for me
an instrument that he thought would do this, and we discussed the
possibility of constructing one. I did not make it; it was altogether
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
too costly, and the chances of its
working too uncertain to impress
his financial backers&mdash;Mr. Gardiner
G. Hubbard and Mr. Thomas Sanders&mdash;who
were insisting that the
wisest thing for Bell to do was to
perfect the harmonic telegraph;
then he would have money and
leisure enough to build air castles
like the telephone.</p>
<h3 id="c7">June 2, 1875</h3>
<p>I must have done other work in
the shop besides Bell&rsquo;s during the
winter and spring of 1875, but I
cannot remember a single item of
it. I do remember that when I was
not working for Bell I was thinking
of his ideas. All through my
recollection of that period runs
that nightmare&mdash;the harmonic telegraph, the ill working of which got
on my conscience, for I blamed my lack of mechanical skill for the
poor operation of an invention apparently so simple. Try our best, we
could not make that thing work rightly, and Bell came as near to
being discouraged as I ever knew him to be.</p>
<p>But this spring of 1875 was the dark hour just before the dawn.</p>
<p>If the exact time could be fixed, the date when the conception of the
undulatory or speech-transmitting current took its perfect form in
Bell&rsquo;s mind would be the greatest day in the history of the telephone,
but certainly June 2, 1875, must always rank next; for on that day
the mocking fiend inhabiting that demonic telegraph apparatus, just
as a now-you-see-it-and-now-you-don&rsquo;t sort of satanic joke, opened
the curtain that hides from man great Nature&rsquo;s secrets and gave us a
glimpse as quick as if it were through the shutter of a snap-shot
camera, into that treasury of things not yet discovered. That imp
didn&rsquo;t do this in any kindly, helpful spirit&mdash;any inventor knows he
isn&rsquo;t that kind of a being&mdash;he just meant to tantalize and prove that
a man is too stupid to grasp a secret, even if it is revealed to him.
But he hadn&rsquo;t properly estimated Bell, though he had probably sized
me up all right. That glimpse was enough to let Bell see and seize the
very thing he had been dreaming about and drag it out into the world
of human affairs.</p>

<h3 id="c8">The Telephone Born</h3>
<p>Coming back to earth, I&rsquo;ll try and tell you what happened that day.
In the experiments on the harmonic telegraph, Bell had found that
the reason why the messages got mixed up was inaccuracy in the
adjustment of the pitches of the receiver springs to those of the
transmitter. Bell always had to do this tuning himself, as my sense of
pitch and knowledge of music were quite lacking&mdash;a faculty (or
lackulty) which you will hear later became quite useful. Mr. Bell was
in the habit of observing the pitch of a spring by pressing it against
his ear while the corresponding transmitter in a distant room was
sending its intermittent current through the magnet of that receiver.
He would then manipulate the tuning screw until that spring was
tuned to accord with the pitch of the whine coming from the transmitter.
All this experimenting was carried on in the upper story of
the Williams building, where we had a wire connecting two rooms
perhaps sixty feet apart looking out on Court Street.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Prof. Bell&rsquo;s Vibrating Reed&mdash;Used for a Receiver</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c9">Realization</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of June 2, 1875, we were hard at work on the
same old job, testing some modification of the instruments. Things
were badly out of tune that afternoon in that hot garret, not only the
instruments, but, I fancy, my enthusiasm and my temper, though Bell
was as energetic as ever. I had charge of the transmitters as usual,
setting them squealing one after the other, while Bell was retuning
the receiver springs one by one, pressing them against his ear as I
have described. One of the transmitter springs I was attending to
stopped vibrating and I plucked it to start it again. It didn&rsquo;t start
and I kept on plucking it, when suddenly I heard a shout from Bell
in the next room, and then out he came with a rush, demanding,
&ldquo;What did you do then? Don&rsquo;t change anything. Let me see!&rdquo; I
showed him. It was very simple. The contact screw was screwed down
so far that it made permanent contact with the spring, so that when
I snapped the spring the circuit had remained unbroken while that
strip of magnetized steel by its vibration over the pole of its
magnet was generating that marvelous conception of Bell&rsquo;s&mdash;a
current of electricity that varied in intensity precisely as the air was
varying in density within hearing distance of that spring. That
undulatory current had passed through the connecting wire to the
distant receiver which, fortunately, was a mechanism that could
transform that current back into an extremely faint echo of the sound
of the vibrating spring that had generated it, but what was still more
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
fortunate, the right man had that mechanism at his ear during that
fleeting moment, and instantly recognized the transcendent importance
of that faint sound thus electrically transmitted. The shout I heard
and his excited rush into my room were the result of that recognition.
The speaking telephone was born at that moment. Bell knew perfectly
well that the mechanism that could transmit all the complex vibrations
of one sound could do the same for any sound, even that of
speech. That experiment showed him that the complex apparatus he
had thought would be needed to accomplish that long dreamed result
was not at all necessary, for here was an extremely simple mechanism
operating in a perfectly obvious way, that could do it perfectly. All
the experimenting that followed that discovery, up to the time the
telephone was put into practical use, was largely a matter of working
out the details. We spent a few hours verifying the discovery,
repeating it with all the differently tuned springs we had, and before
we parted that night Bell gave me directions for making the first
electric speaking telephone. I was to mount a small drumhead of
gold-beater&rsquo;s skin over one of the receivers, join the center of the
drumhead to the free end of the receiver spring and arrange a mouthpiece
over the drumhead to talk into. His idea was to force the steel
spring to follow the vocal vibrations and generate a current of electricity
that would vary in intensity as the air varies in density during
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the utterance of speech sounds. I followed these directions and had
the instrument ready for its trial the very next day. I rushed it,
for Bell&rsquo;s excitement and enthusiasm over the discovery had aroused
mine again, which had been sadly dampened during those last few
weeks by the meagre results of the harmonic experiments. I made
every part of that first telephone myself, but I didn&rsquo;t realize while
I was working on it what a tremendously important piece of work I
was doing.</p>
<h3 id="c10">The First Telephone Line</h3>
<p>The two rooms in the attic were too near together for the test, as
our voices would be heard through the air, so I ran a wire especially
for the trial from one of the rooms in the attic down two flights to
the third floor where Williams&rsquo;
main shop was, ending
it near my work bench
at the back of the building.
That was the first telephone
line. You can well imagine
that both our hearts were
beating above the normal
rate while we were getting
ready for the trial of the
new instrument that evening.
I got more satisfaction
from the experiment
than Mr. Bell did, for shout
my best I could not make
him hear me, but I could
hear his voice and almost
catch the words. I rushed
downstairs and told him
what I had heard. It was
enough to show him that he
was on the right track, and
before he left that night he
gave me directions for several
improvements in the
telephones I was to have
ready for the next trial.</p>

<p>I hope my pride in the
fact that I made the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
telephone, put up the first telephone wire and heard the first words
ever uttered through a telephone, has never been too ostentatious and
offensive to my friends, but I am sure that you will grant that a
reasonable amount of that human weakness is excusable in me. My
pride has been tempered to quite a bearable degree by my realization
that the reason why I heard Bell in that first trial of the telephone
and he did not hear me, was the vast superiority of his strong
vibratory tones over any sound my undeveloped voice was then able to
utter. My sense of hearing, however, has always been unusually acute,
and that might have helped to determine this result.</p>
<p>The building where these first telephone experiments were made is
still in existence. It is now used as a theater. The lower stories have been
much altered, but that attic is still quite unchanged and a few weeks
ago I stood on the very spot where I snapped those springs and helped
test the first telephone thirty-seven years and seven months before.</p>

<p>(<i>Editor&rsquo;s Note: The old building was finally replaced by new construction in 1931.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c11">Mr. Watson Heard the First Sentence Ever Spoken Over the Telephone</h3>
<p>Of course in our struggle to expel the imps from the invention, an
immense amount of experimenting had to be done, but it wasn&rsquo;t many
days before we could talk back and forth and hear each other&rsquo;s voice.
It is, however, hard for me to realize now that it was not until the
following March that I heard a complete and intelligible sentence. It
made such an impression upon me that I wrote that first sentence in
a book I have always preserved. The occasion had not been arranged
and rehearsed as I suspect the sending of the first message over the
Morse telegraph had been years before, for instead of that noble first
telegraphic message&mdash;&ldquo;What hath God wrought?&rdquo; the first message
of the telephone was: &ldquo;Mr. Watson, come here, I want you.&rdquo; Perhaps,
if Mr. Bell had realized that he was about to make a bit of history,
he would have been prepared with a more sounding and interesting
sentence.</p>
<p>Soon after the first telephones were made, Bell hired two rooms on
the top floor of an inexpensive boarding house at No. 5 Exeter Place,
Boston, since demolished to make room for mercantile buildings. He
slept in one room; the other he fitted up as a laboratory. I ran a wire
for him between the two rooms and after that time practically all his
experimenting was done there. It was here one evening when I had
gone there to help him test some improvement and to spend the night
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
with him, that I heard the first complete sentence I have just told you
about. Matters began to move more rapidly, and during the summer
of 1876 the telephone was talking so well that one didn&rsquo;t have to ask
the other man to say it over again more than three or four times
before one could understand quite well, if the sentences were simple.</p>
<h3 id="c12">The Centennial Exposition</h3>
<p>This was the year of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia,
and Bell decided to make an exhibit there. I was still working for
Williams, and one of the jobs I did for Bell was to construct a
telephone of each form that had been devised up to that time. These
were the first nicely finished instruments that had been made. There
had been no money nor time to waste on polish or non-essentials. But
these Centennial telephones were done up in the highest style of the
art. You could see your face in them. These aristocratic telephones
worked finely, in spite of their glitter, when Sir William Thompson
tried them at Philadelphia that summer. I was as proud as Bell himself,
when I read Sir William&rsquo;s report, wherein he said after giving
an account of the tests: &ldquo;I need hardly say I was astonished and
delighted, so were the others who witnessed the experiment and
verified with their own ears the electric transmission of speech. This,
perhaps, the greatest marvel hitherto achieved by electric telegraph,
has been obtained by appliances of quite a homespun and rudimentary
character.&rdquo; I have never forgiven Sir William for that last line.
Homespun!</p>
<h3 id="c13">Experimentation</h3>
<p>However, I recovered from this blow, and soon after Mr. Gardiner
G. Hubbard, afterwards Mr. Bell&rsquo;s father-in-law, offered me an
interest in Bell&rsquo;s patents if I would give up my work at Williams&rsquo;
and devote my time to the telephone. I accepted, although I wasn&rsquo;t
altogether sure it was a wise thing to do from a financial standpoint.
My contract stipulated that I was to work under Mr. Bell&rsquo;s directions,
on the harmonic telegraph as well as on the speaking telephone, for
the two men who were paying the bills still thought there was something
in the former invention, although very little attention had been
given to its vagaries after the June 2nd discovery.</p>

</div>
<p>I moved my domicile from Salem to another room on the top floor
at 5 Exeter Place, giving us the entire floor, and as Mr. Bell had lost
most of his pupils by wasting so much of his time on telephones, he
could devote nearly all his time to the experimenting. Then followed
a period of hard and continuous work on the invention. I made
telephones with every modification and combination of their essential
parts that either of us could think of. I made and we tested telephones
with all sizes of diaphragms made of all kinds of materials&mdash;diaphragms
of boiler iron several feet in diameter, down to a miniature
affair made of the bones and drum of a human ear, and found that the
best results came from an iron diaphragm of about the same size and
thickness as is used to-day. We tested electro magnets and permanent
magnets of a multitude of sizes and shapes, with long cores and short
cores, fat cores and thin cores, solid cores and cores of wire, with coils
of many sizes, shapes and resistances, and mouthpieces of an infinite
variety. Out of the hundreds of experiments there emerged practically
the same telephone you take off the hook and listen with to-day,
although it was then transmitter as well as receiver.</p>

<p>The following account of an experiment made
on the evening of October 9 by Alexander Graham
Bell and Thomas A. Watson is interesting, as being
the record of the first conversation ever carried
on by word of mouth over a telegraph wire. Telephones
placed at either end of a telegraph
line owned by the Walworth Manufacturing Company,
extending from their office in Boston to
their factory in Cambridgeport, a distance of
about two miles. The company&rsquo;s battery, consisting
of nine Daniels cells, was removed from the
circuit and another of ten carbon elements substituted.
Articulate conversation then took place
through the wire. The sounds, at first faint and
indistinct, became suddenly quite loud and intelligible.
Mr. Bell in Boston and Mr. Watson in
Cambridge then took notes of what was said and
heard and the comparison of the two records is
most interesting, as showing the accuracy of the
electrical transmission:&mdash;</p>

<h3 id="c14">&ldquo;Talking&rdquo; from Boston to Cambridge</h3>
<p>Progress was rapid, and on October 9, 1876, we were ready to take
the baby outdoors for the first time. We got permission from the
Walworth Manufacturing Company to use their private wire running
from Boston to Cambridge, about two miles long. I went to Cambridge
that evening with one of our best telephones, and waited until
Bell signalled from the Boston office on the Morse sounder. Then I
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
cut out the sounder and connected in the telephone and listened. Not
a murmur came through! Could it be that, although the thing worked
all right in the house, it wouldn&rsquo;t work under practical line conditions?
I knew that we were using the most complex and delicate electric
current that had ever been employed for a practical purpose and that
it was extremely &ldquo;intense,&rdquo; for Bell had talked through a circuit composed
of 20 or 30 human beings joined hand to hand. Could it be, I
thought, that these high tension vibrations leaking off at each insulator
along the line, had vanished completely before they reached
the Charles River? That fear passed through my mind as I worked
over the instrument, adjusting it and tightening the wires in the binding
posts, without improving matters in the least. Then the thought
struck me that perhaps there was another Morse sounder in some
other room. I traced the wires from the place they entered the building
and sure enough I found a relay with a high resistance coil in
the circuit. I cut it out with a piece of wire across the binding posts
and rushed back to my telephone and listened. That was the trouble.
Plainly as one could wish came Bell&rsquo;s &ldquo;ahoy,&rdquo; &ldquo;ahoy!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> I ahoyed
back, and the first long distance telephone conversation began. Skeptics
had been objecting that the telephone could never compete with
the telegraph as its messages would not be accurate. For this reason
Bell had arranged that we should make a record of all we said and
heard that night, if we succeeded in talking at all. We carried out
this plan and the entire conversation was published in parallel columns
in the next morning&rsquo;s <i>Advertiser</i>, as the latest startling scientific
achievement. Infatuated with the joy of talking over an actual telegraph
wire, we kept up our conversation until long after midnight.
It was a very happy boy that traveled back to Boston in the small
hours with the telephone under his arm done up in a newspaper. Bell
had taken his record to the newspaper office and was not at the
laboratory when I arrived there, but when he came in there ensued a
jubilation and war dance that elicited next morning from our landlady,
who wasn&rsquo;t at all scientific in her tastes, the remark that we&rsquo;d
have to vacate if we didn&rsquo;t make less noise nights.</p>
<p>Tests on still longer telegraph lines soon followed&mdash;the success of
each experiment being in rather exact accordance with the condition
of the poor, rusty-joined wires we had to use. Talk about imps that
baffle inventors! There was one of an especially vicious and malignant
type in every unsoldered joint of the old wires. The genial Tom
Doolittle hadn&rsquo;t even thought of his hard-drawn copper wire then,
with which he later eased the lot of the struggling telephone men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h3 id="c15">Our Many Visitors</h3>
<p>Meanwhile the
fame of the invention
had spread
rapidly abroad and
all sorts of people
made pilgrimages
to Bell&rsquo;s laboratory
to hear the telephone
talk. A list
of the scientists
who came to the
attic of that cheap
boarding house to see the telephone would read like the roster of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science. My old electrical
mentor, Moses G. Farmer, called one day to see the latest improvements.
He told me then with tears in his eyes when he first read
a description of Bell&rsquo;s telephone he couldn&rsquo;t sleep for a week, he was
so mad with himself for not discovering the thing years before.
&ldquo;Watson,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that thing has flaunted itself in my very face a
dozen times within the last ten years and every time I was too blind
to see it. But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if Bell had known anything about
electricity he would never have invented the telephone.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Two of our regular visitors were young Japanese pupils of Professor
Bell&mdash;very polite, deferential, quiet, bright-eyed little men, who
saw everything and made cryptic notes. They took huge delight in
proving that the telephone could talk Japanese. A curious effect of the
telephone I noticed at that time was its power to paralyze the tongues
of men otherwise fluent enough by nature and profession. I remember
a prominent lawyer who, when he heard my voice in the telephone
making some such profound remark to him as &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; could
only reply, after a long pause, &ldquo;Rig a jig jig and away we go.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c16">A &ldquo;Wireless Telephone&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Men of quite another sort came occasionally. Mr. Hubbard received
a letter one day from a man who wrote that he could put us on the
track of a secret that would enable us to talk any distance without
a wire. This interested Mr. Hubbard and he made an appointment
for the man to meet me. At the appointed time, a stout, rather
unkempt man made his appearance. He didn&rsquo;t take the least interest
in the telephone; he said that was already a back number, and if we
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
would hire him for a small sum
per week we would soon learn
how to telephone without any
apparatus or any wires. He went
on to tell in a most convincing
way how two prominent theatrical
men in New York, whom he
had never seen, had got his brain
so connected into their circuit
that they could talk with him at
any time, day or night, and make
all sorts of fiendish suggestions
to him. He didn&rsquo;t know yet how
they did it, but he was sure I
could find out their secret, if I
would just take the top off his
head and examine his brain. It
dawned on me then that I was
dealing with an insane man. I
got rid of him as soon as I could by promising to experiment on
him when I could find time. The next I heard of the poor fellow
he was in the violent ward of an insane asylum. Several similar cases
of insanity attracted by the fame of Bell&rsquo;s occult (!) invention called
on us or wrote to us within a year of that time.</p>

<h3 id="c17">Telephone Installations</h3>
<p>We began to get requests for telephone installations long before
we were ready to supply them. In April, 1877, the first outdoor
telephone line was run between Mr. Williams&rsquo; office at 109 Court
Street and his house in Somerville. Professor Bell and I were present
and participated in the important ceremony of opening the line and
the event was a headliner in the next morning&rsquo;s papers.</p>
<h3 id="c18">Financial Problems</h3>
<p>At about this time Professor Bell&rsquo;s financial problems had begun to
press hard for solution. We were very much disappointed because
the President of the Western Union Telegraph Company had refused,
somewhat contemptuously, Mr. Hubbard&rsquo;s offer to sell him all the
Bell patents for the exorbitant sum of $100,000. It was an especially
hard blow to me, for while the negotiations were pending I had had
visions of a sumptuous office in the Western Union Building in New
York, which I was expecting to occupy as Superintendent of the
Telephone Department of the great telegraph company. However, we
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
recovered even from that facer. Two years later the
Western Union would gladly have bought those patents for $25,000,000.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Original Box Telephone Introduced Commercially in 1877</i></p>
</div>
<p>But before that happy time there were lots of
troubles of all the old and of several new varieties to
be surmounted. Professor Bell&rsquo;s particular trouble in
the spring of 1877 arose from the fact that he had
fallen in love with a most charming young lady. I
had never been in love myself at that time and that was my first
opportunity of observing what a serious matter it can be, especially
when the father isn&rsquo;t altogether enthusiastic. I rather suspected at
that time that that shrewd but kind-hearted gentleman put obstacles
in the course of that true love, in order to stimulate the young man
to still greater exertion in perfecting his inventions. But he might
have thought as Prospero did:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;They are both in either&rsquo;s power; but this swift business</p>
<p class="t0">I must uneasy make, lest too light winning</p>
<p class="t0">Make the prize light.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Bell&rsquo;s immediate financial needs were solved, however, by the
demand that began at this time for public lectures by him on the telephone.
It is hard to realize to-day what an intense and widespread
interest there was then in the telephone. I don&rsquo;t believe any new invention
could stir the public to-day as the telephone did then, surfeited
as we are now with the wonderful things that have been invented since.</p>
<h3 id="c19">Leasing Instruments a Far-Sighted Policy</h3>
<p>These lectures are important for another reason than that they
solved a temporary money problem. They obviated the necessity of
selling telephones outright, instead of leasing them so as to retain
control&mdash;a policy Mr. Hubbard afterwards adopted which made possible
the splendid universal service Mr. Vail with your help has given
the Bell system to-day. Some of the ladies deeply interested in the
immediate outcome were strenuously advocating at this critical juncture
making and selling the telephones at once in the largest possible
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
quantities&mdash;imperfect as they were. Fortunately, for the future of
the business the returns from the lectures that began at this very
time obviated this danger.</p>
<h3 id="c20">Telephone Lectures</h3>
<p>Bell&rsquo;s first lecture, as I have said, was given before a well-known
scientific society&mdash;the Essex Institute&mdash;at Salem, Mass. They were
especially interested in the telephone because Bell was living in Salem
during the early telephone experiments. The first lecture was free to
members of the society, but it packed the hall and created so much
interest that Bell was requested to repeat it for an admission fee.
This he did to an audience that again filled the house. Requests for
lectures poured in upon Bell after that. Such men as Oliver Wendell
Holmes and Henry W. Longfellow signed the request for the Boston
lectures. The Salem lectures were soon followed by a lecture in
Providence to an audience of 2,000, by a course of three lectures at
the largest hall in Boston&mdash;all three packed&mdash;by three in Chickering
Hall, New York, and by others in most of the large cities of New
England. They all took place in the spring and early summer of 1877,
during which time there was little opportunity for experimenting for
either Bell or myself, which I think now was rather a good thing, for
we had become quite stale and needed a change that would give us
a new influx of ideas. My part in the lectures was important, although
entirely invisible as far as the audience was concerned. I was always
at the other end of the wire, generating and transmitting to the hall
where Professor Bell was speaking, such telephonic phenomena as he
needed to illustrate his lectures. I would have at my end circuit
breakers&mdash;rheotomes, we called them&mdash;that would utter electric howls
of various pitches, a lusty cornet player, sometimes a small brass
band, and an electric organ with Edward Wilson to play on it, but the
star performer was the young man who two years before didn&rsquo;t have
voice enough to let Bell hear his own telephone, but in whom that two
years of strenuous shouting into mouthpieces of various sizes and
shapes had developed a voice with the carrying capacity of a steam
calliope. My special function in these lectures was to show the audience
that the telephone could really talk. Not only that, I had to do all
the singing, too, for which my musical deficiencies fitted me admirably.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c21">My Telephone Entertainers</h3>
<p>Professor Bell would have one telephone by his side on the stage,
where he was speaking, and three or four others of the big box variety
we used at that time would be suspended about the hall, all connected
by means of a hired telegraph wire with the place where I was
stationed, from five to twenty-five miles away. Bell would give the
audience, first, the commonplace parts of the show and then would
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
come the thrillers of the evening&mdash;my shouts and songs. I would
shout such sentences as, &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; &ldquo;What
do you think of the telephone?&rdquo; which they could all hear, although
the words issued from the mouthpieces rather badly marred by the
defective talking powers of the telephones of that date. Then I
would sing &ldquo;Hold the Fort,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pull for the Shore,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yankee Doodle,&rdquo;
and as a delicate allusion to the Professor&rsquo;s nationality, &ldquo;Auld Lang
Syne.&rdquo; My sole sentimental song was &ldquo;Do Not Trust Him, Gentle
Lady.&rdquo; This repertoire always brought down the house. After every
song I would listen at my telephone for further directions from the
lecturer, and always felt the artist&rsquo;s joy when I heard in it the long
applause that followed each of my efforts. I was always encored to the
limit of my repertoire and sometimes had to sing it through twice.</p>
<p>I have always understood that Professor Bell was a fine platform
speaker, but this is entirely hearsay on my part for, although I spoke
at every one of his lectures, I have never yet had the pleasure of
hearing him deliver an address.</p>
<h3 id="c22">First Sound-Proof Booth</h3>
<p>In making the preparations for the New York lectures I incidentally
invented the sound-proof booth, but as Mr. Lockwood was not then
associated with us, and for other reasons, I never patented it. It
happened thus: Bell thought he would like to astonish the New
Yorkers by having his lecture illustrations sent all the way from
Boston. To determine whether this was practicable, he made arrangements
to test the telephone a few days before on one of the Atlantic
and Pacific wires. The trial was to take place at midnight. Bell
was at the New York end, I was in the Boston laboratory. Having
vividly in mind the strained relations already existing with our landlady,
and realizing the carrying power of my voice when I really let
it go, as I knew I should have to that night, I cast about for some
device to deaden the noise. Time was short and appliances scarce,
so the best I could do was to take the blankets off our beds and
arrange them in a sort of loose tunnel, with the telephone tied up in
one end and the other end open for the operator to crawl into. Thus
equipped I awaited the signal from New York announcing that Bell
was ready. It came soon after midnight. Then I connected in the
telephone, deposited myself in that cavity, and shouted and listened
for two or three hours. It didn&rsquo;t work as well as it might. It is a
wonder some of my remarks didn&rsquo;t burn holes in the blankets. We
talked after a fashion but Bell decided it wasn&rsquo;t safe to risk it
with a New York audience. My sound-proof booth, however, was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
complete success, as far as stopping the sound was concerned, for I
found by cautious inquiry next day that nobody had heard my row.
Later inventors improved my booth, making it more comfortable for
a pampered public but not a bit more sound-proof.</p>

<h3 id="c23">&ldquo;The Supposititious Mr. Watson&rdquo;</h3>
<p>One of those New York lectures looms large in my memory on
account of a novel experience I had at my end of the wire. After
hearing me sing, the manager of the lectures decided that while I
might satisfy a Boston audience I would never do for a New York
congregation, so he engaged a fine baritone soloist&mdash;a powerful negro,
who was to assume the singing part of my program. Being much
better acquainted with the telephone than that manager was, I had
doubts about the advisability of this change in the cast. I didn&rsquo;t say
anything, as I didn&rsquo;t want to be accused of professional jealousy, and
I knew my repertoire would be on the spot in case things went wrong.
I was stationed that night at the telegraph office at New Brunswick,
New Jersey, and I and the rest of the usual appliances of that end
of the lecture went down in the afternoon to get things ready. I
rehearsed my rival and found him a fine singer, but had difficulty in
getting him to crowd his lips into the mouthpiece. He was handicapped
for the telephone business by being musical, and he didn&rsquo;t
like the sound of his voice jammed up in that way. However, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
promised to do what I wanted when it came to the actual work of
the evening, and I went to supper. When I returned to the telegraph
office, just before eight o&rsquo;clock, I found to my horror that the young
lady operator had invited six or eight of her dear friends to witness
the interesting proceedings. Now, besides my musical deficiencies, I
had another qualification as a telephone man&mdash;I was very modest; in
fact, in the presence of ladies, extremely bashful. It didn&rsquo;t trouble
me in the least to talk or sing to a great audience, provided, of course,
it was a few miles away, but when I saw those girls, the complacency
with which I had been contemplating the probable failure of my fine
singer was changed to painful apprehension. If he wasn&rsquo;t successful
a very bashful young man would have a new experience. I should
be obliged to sing myself before those giggling, unscientific girls.
This world would be a better place to live in if we all tried to help
our fellow-men succeed, as I tried that night, when the first song was
called for, to make my musical friend achieve a lyrical triumph on
the Metropolitan stage. But he sang that song for the benefit of
those girls, not for Chickering Hall, and it was with a heavy heart
that I listened for Bell&rsquo;s voice when he finished it. The blow fell.
In his most delightful platform tones, Bell uttered the fatal words I
had foreboded, &ldquo;Mr. Watson,
the audience could not hear
that. Won&rsquo;t you please sing?&rdquo;
Bell was always a kind-hearted
man, but he didn&rsquo;t
know. However, I nerved myself
with the thought that
that New York audience,
made skeptical by the failure
of that song, might be thinking
cynical things about my
beloved leader and his telephone,
so I turned my back
on those girls and made that
telephone rattle with the
stirring strains of &ldquo;Hold the
Fort,&rdquo; as it never had before.
Then I listened again. Ah,
the sweetness of appreciation! That New York audience was applauding
vigorously. When it stopped, the same voice came with a new note
of triumph in it. &ldquo;Mr. Watson, the audience heard that perfectly and
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
call for an encore.&rdquo; I sang through my entire repertoire and began
again on &ldquo;Hold the Fort,&rdquo; before that audience was satisfied. That
experience did me good, I have never had stage fright since. But the
&ldquo;supposititious Mr. Watson,&rdquo; as they called me then, had to do the
singing at all of Bell&rsquo;s subsequent lectures. Nobody else had a chance
at the job; one experience was enough for Mr. Bell.</p>
<p>My baritone had his hat on his head and a cynical expression on his
face, when I finished working on those songs. &ldquo;Is that what you
wanted?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, boss, I couldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Of course
he couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="c24">An Exhibition in Lawrence</h3>
<p>Another occasion is burnt into my memory that wasn&rsquo;t such a
triumph over difficulties. In these lectures we always had another
trouble to contend with, besides the rusty joints in the wires; that
was the operators cutting in, during the lectures, their highest resistance
relays, which enabled them to hear some of the intermittent
current effects I sent to the hall. Inductance, retardation, and all
that sort of thing which you have so largely conquered since were
invented long before the telephone was, and were awaiting her on
earth all ready to slam it when Bell came along. Bell lectured
at Lawrence, Massachusetts, one evening in May, and I prepared to
furnish him with the usual program from the laboratory in Boston.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="349" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Watson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Buzzer&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<p>But the wire the company assigned us was the worst yet. It worked
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
fairly well when we tried it in the afternoon, but in the evening
every station on the line had evidently cut in its relay, and do my
best I couldn&rsquo;t get a sound through to the hall.</p>
<p>The local newspaper generally sent a reporter to my end of the
wire to write up the occurrences there. This is the report of such
an envoy as it appeared in the Lawrence paper the morning after
Bell&rsquo;s lecture there:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fisher returned this morning. He says that Watson, the
organist and himself occupied the laboratory, sitting in their shirt
sleeves with their collars off. Watson shouted his lungs into the
telephone mouthpiece, &lsquo;Hoy! Hoy! Hoy!&rsquo; and receiving no response,
inquired of Fisher if he pardoned for a little &lsquo;hamburg edging&rsquo; on
his language. Mr. Fisher endeavored to transmit to his Lawrence
townsman the tune of &lsquo;Federal Street&rsquo; played upon the cornet, but
the air was not distinguishable here. About 10 P.M., Watson discovered
the &lsquo;Northern Lights&rsquo; and found his wires alive with lightning,
which was not included in the original scheme of the telephone. He
says the loose electricity abroad in the world was too much for him.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c25">Waiting for Watson</h3>
<p>The next morning a poem appeared in the Lawrence paper. The
writer must have sat up all night to write it. It was entitled &ldquo;Waiting
for Watson,&rdquo; and as I am very proud of the only poem I ever had
written about me, I am going to ask your permission to read it.
Please notice the great variety of human feeling the poet put into it.
It even suggests missiles, though it flings none.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The First Telephone Advertisement, Used the Year Following the Issuance of
the Original Patent, Offered to Furnish Telephones &ldquo;for the Transmission of
Articulate Speech Through Instruments Not More Than Twenty Miles Apart.&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="center"><span class="large">The Telephone.</span></p>
<p>The proprietors of the Telephone, the invention of Alexander Graham Bell, for which patents have been
issued by the United States and Great Britain, are now prepared to furnish Telephones for the transmission
of articulate speech through instruments not more than twenty miles apart. Conversation can be easily
carried on after slight practice and with the occasional repetition of a word or sentence. On first listening to
the Telephone, though the sound is perfectly audible, the articulation seems to be indistinct; but after a few
trials the ear becomes accustomed to the peculiar sound and finds little difficulty in understanding the words.</p>
<p>The Telephone should be set in a quiet place, where there is no noise which would interrupt ordinary
conversation.</p>
<p>The advantages of the Telephone over the Telegraph for local business are</p>
<p>1st. That no skilled operator is required, but direct communication may be had by speech without the
intervention of a third person.</p>
<p>2d. That the communication is much more rapid, the average number of words transmitted a minute
by Morse Sounder being from fifteen to twenty, by Telephone from one to two hundred.</p>
<p>3d. That no expense is required either for its operation, maintenance, or repair. It needs no battery,
and has no complicated machinery. It is unsurpassed for economy and simplicity.</p>
<p>The Terms for leasing two Telephones for social purposes connecting a dwelling-house with any other
building will be $20 a year, for business purposes $40 a year, payable semiannually in advance, with the
cost of expressage from Boston, New York, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, or San Francisco. The instruments
will be kept in good working order by the lessors, free of expense, except from injuries resulting from great
carelessness.</p>
<p>Several Telephones can be placed on the same line at an additional rental of $10 for each instrument;
but the use of more than two on the some line where privacy is required is not advised. Any person within
ordinary hearing distance can hear the voice calling through the Telephone. If a louder call is required one
can be furnished for $5.</p>
<p>Telegraph lines will be constructed by the proprietors if desired. The price will vary from $100 to $150
a mile; any good mechanic can construct a line; No. 9 wire costs 8&frac12; cents a pound, 320 pounds to the
mile; 34 insulators at 25 cents each; the price of poles and setting varies in every locality; stringing wire
$5 per mile; sundries $10 per mile.</p>
<p>Parties leasing the Telephones incur no expense beyond the annual rental and the repair of the line
wire. On the following pages are extracts from the Press and other sources relating to the Telephone.</p>

<h3 id="c27">My Last Public Appearance</h3>
<p>But my vacation was about over. Besides raising the wind, the
lectures had stirred up a great demand for telephone lines. The
public was ready for the telephone long before we were ready for
the public, and this pleasant artistic interlude had to stop; I was
needed in the shop to build some telephones to satisfy the insistent
demand. Fred Gower, a young newspaper man of Providence, had
become interested with Mr. Bell in the lecture work. He had an
unique scheme for a dual lecture with my illustrations sent from a
central point to halls in two cities at the same time. I think my last
appearance in public was one of these dualities. Bell lectured at
New Haven and Gower gave the talk at Hartford, while I was in
between at Middletown, Conn., with my
apparatus, including my songs. It
didn&rsquo;t work very well. The two lecturers
didn&rsquo;t speak synchronously.
Gower told me afterwards that I was
giving him, &ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; when he
wanted &ldquo;Hold the Fort,&rdquo; and Bell said
I made it awkward for him by singing
&ldquo;Do Not Trust Him, Gentle Lady,&rdquo;
when he needed the trombone solo.</p>
<h3 id="c28">The &ldquo;Gower-Bell&rdquo; Telephone</h3>
<p>In the following August, Professor
Bell married and went to England,
taking with him a complete set of up-to-date
telephones, with which he intended
to start the trouble in that
country. Fred Gower became so fascinated
with lecturing on the telephone
that he gave up an exclusive right Mr.
Hubbard had granted him for renting
telephones all over New England, for
the exclusive privilege of using the
telephone for lecture purposes all over
the United States. But it wasn&rsquo;t remunerative
after Bell and I gave it up.
The discriminating public preferred
Mr. Bell as speaker&mdash;and I always felt that the singing never reached
the early heights.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Gower went to England later. There he made some small modification
of Bell&rsquo;s telephone, called it the &ldquo;Gower-Bell&rdquo; telephone, and
made a fortune out of his hyphenated atrocity. Later he married
Lillian Nordica, although she soon separated from him. He became
interested in ballooning. The last scene in his life before the curtain
dropped showed a balloon over the waters of the English Channel.
A fishing boat hails him, &ldquo;Where are you bound?&rdquo; Gower&rsquo;s voice
replies, &ldquo;To London.&rdquo; Then the balloon and its pilot drifted into the
mist forever.</p>
<h3 id="c29">Developing a Calling Apparatus; the Watson &ldquo;Buzzer&rdquo;</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig22">

<p class="pcap"><i>Francis Blake</i></p>
</div>
<p>As I said, I went back to work, and my next two years was a
continuous performance. It began to dawn on us that people engaged
in getting their living in
the ordinary walks of life
couldn&rsquo;t be expected to keep
the telephone at their ear
all the time waiting for a
call, especially as it weighed
about ten pounds then and
was as big as a small packing
case, so it devolved on
me to get up some sort of
a call signal. Williams on
his line used to call by
thumping the diaphragm
through the mouthpiece
with the butt of a lead pencil.
If there was someone
close to the telephone at the
other end, and it was very
still, it did pretty well, but
it seriously damaged the
vitals of the machine and
therefore I decided it wasn&rsquo;t
really practical for the
general public; besides, we
might have to supply a pencil
with every telephone and
that would be expensive. Then I rigged a little hammer inside the
box with a button on the outside. When the button was thumped the
hammer would hit the side of the diaphragm where it could not be
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
damaged, the usual electrical transformation took place, and a much
more modest but still unmistakable thump would issue from the
telephone at the other end.</p>
<p>That was the first calling apparatus ever devised for use with the
telephone, not counting Williams&rsquo; lead pencil, and several with that
attachment were put into practical use. But the exacting public
wanted something better, and I devised the Watson &ldquo;Buzzer&rdquo;&mdash;the
only practical use we ever made of the harmonic telegraph relics.
Many of these were sent out. It was a vast improvement on the
Watson &ldquo;Thumper,&rdquo; but still it didn&rsquo;t take the popular fancy. It
made a sound quite like the horseradish grater automobile signal we
are so familiar with nowadays, and aroused just the same feeling
of resentment which that
does. It brought me only
a fleeting fame for I soon
superseded it by a magneto-electric
call bell that
solved the problem, and
was destined to make a
long-suffering public turn
cranks for the next fifteen
years or so, as it never
had before, or ever will
hereafter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="547" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The Blake Transmitter</i></p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps I didn&rsquo;t have
any trouble with the
plaguy thing! The generator
part of it was only
an adaptation of a magneto
shocking machine I found in Davis&rsquo; Manual of Magnetism and
worked well enough, but I was guilty of the jingling part of it. At
any rate, I felt guilty when letters began to come from our agents
reciting their woes with the thing, which they said had a trick of
sticking and failing on the most important occasions to tinkle in response
to the frantic crankings of the man who wanted you. But I
soon got it so it behaved itself and it has been good ever since, for
Chief Engineer Carty told me the other day that nothing better has
ever been invented, that they have been manufactured by the millions
all over the world, and that identical jingler to-day does practically
all the world&rsquo;s telephone calling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h3 id="c30">&ldquo;Williams&rsquo; Coffins&rdquo;</h3>
<p>For some reason, my usual good luck I presume, the magneto call
bells didn&rsquo;t get my name attached to them. I never regretted this, for
the agents, who bought them from Williams, impressed by the long
and narrow box in which the mechanism was placed, promptly christened
them &ldquo;Williams&rsquo; Coffins.&rdquo; I always thought that a narrow escape
for me!</p>
<p>The first few hundreds of these call bells were a continuous shock
to me for other reasons than their failure to respond. I used on them
a switch, that had to be thrown one way by hand, when the telephone
was being used, and then thrown back by hand to put the bell in
circuit again. But the average man or woman wouldn&rsquo;t do this more
than half the time, and I was obliged to try a series of devices, which
culminated in that remarkable achievement of the human brain&mdash;the
automatic switch&mdash;that only demanded of the public that it should
hang up the telephone after it got through talking. This the public
learned to do quite well after a few years of practice.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h3 id="c31">The Blake Transmitter</h3>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t believe me if I should tell you a tithe of the difficulties
we got into by flexible cords breaking inside the covering, when
we first began to use hand telephones!</p>
<p>Then they began to clamor for switchboards for the first centrals,
and individual call bells began to keep me awake nights. The latter
were very important then, for such luxuries as one station lines were
scarce. Six to twenty stations on a wire was the rule, and we were
trying hard to get a signal that would call one station without disturbing
the whole town. All of these and many other things had to be
done at once, and, as if this was not enough, it suddenly became necessary
for me to devise a battery transmitter. The Western Union
people had discovered that the telephone was not such a toy as they
had thought, and as our $100,000
offer was no longer open for acceptance,
they decided to get a share of
the business for themselves, and
Edison evolved for them his carbon-button
transmitter. This was the
hardest blow yet.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="601" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Theodore N. Vail in 1878</i></p>
</div>
<p>We were still using the magneto
transmitter, although Bell&rsquo;s patent
clearly covered the battery transmitter.
Our transmitter was doing
much to develop the American voice
and lungs, making them powerful
but not melodious. This was, by the
way, the telephone epoch when they
used to say that all the farmers
waiting in a country grocery would
rush out and hold their horses when
they saw any one preparing to use
the telephone. Edison&rsquo;s transmitter talked louder than the magnetos
we were using and our agents began to clamor for them, and I had
to work nights to get up something just as good. Fortunately
for my constitution, Frank Blake came along with his transmitter.
We bought it and I got a little sleep for a few days. Then
our little David of a corporation sued that big Goliath, the Western
Union Company, for infringing the Bell patents, and I had to
devote my leisure to testifying in that suit, and making reproductions
of the earliest apparatus to prove to the court that they would
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
really talk and were not a bluff, as our opponents were asserting.</p>
<p>Then I put in the rest of my leisure making trips among our agents
this side of the Mississippi to bring them up to date and see what the
enemy were up to. I kept a diary of those trips. It reads rather
funnily to-day, but I won&rsquo;t go into that. It would detract from the
seriousness of this discourse.</p>
<h3 id="c32">Wire Troubles</h3>
<p>Nor must I forget an occasional diversion in the way of a sleet
storm which, combining with our wires then beginning to fill the air
with house top lines and pole lines along the sidewalks, would make
things extremely interesting for all concerned. I don&rsquo;t remember ever
going out to erect new poles and run wires after such a catastrophe.
I think I must have done so, but
such a trifling matter naturally
would have made but little impression
upon me.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that my
memory of those two years
seems like a combination of the
Balkan war, the rush hours on
the subway and a panic on the
stock market?</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c33">Memories</h3>
<p>I was always glad I was not
treasurer of the company, although
I filled about all the
other offices during those two
years. Tom Sanders was our
treasurer, and a mighty good
one he made. Had it not been
for his pluck and optimism, we
might all of us have failed to
attain the prosperity that came
to us later. The preparation of
this paper has aroused in me
many delightful memories, but
with them have been mixed sad
thoughts, too, for friends who
have gone. Jovial Tom Sanders!
How everybody loved him! No matter how discouraging the outlook
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
was the skies cleared whenever he came into the shop. I can hear
his ringing laugh now!</p>
<p>It was a red-letter day for me when he hired the first bookkeeper
the telephone business ever had&mdash;the keen, energetic, systematic
Robert W. Devonshire. You must not forget &ldquo;Dev.&rdquo; I never shall,
for after he came I didn&rsquo;t have to keep the list of telephone leases in
my head any more.</p>
<p>Then Thomas D. Lockwood was hired to take part of my engineering
load, but he developed such an extraordinary faculty for comprehending
the intricacies of patents and patent law, that our lawyers
captured him very soon, and kept him at work until he practically
captured their job. And how proud I was when the company could
afford the extravagance of a clerk for
me. He is still working for the company&mdash;Mr.
George W. Pierce.</p>
<p>I suppose I did have some fun during
this time, but the only diversion that
lingers in my mind is arranging telephones
in a diver&rsquo;s helmet for the first
time, and finding that the diver could not
hear when he was under water, going
down myself to see what the matter was.
I still feel the pathos of the moment,
when, arrayed for the descent, just before
I disappeared beneath the limpid
waters of Boston harbor, my usually undemonstrative
assistant put his arm
around my inflated neck and kissed me
on the glass plate.</p>
<h3 id="c34">The Coming of Theodore N. Vail</h3>
<p>But matters soon began to straighten
out&mdash;the clouds gradually cleared away.
The Western Union tornado ceased to
rage, and David found to his delight that
he had hit Goliath squarely in the forehead
with a rock labelled Patent No.
174465. Then for the first time stock
in the Bell Company began to be worth something on the stock market.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Wooden Hand Telephone

</div>
<p>Something else happened about that time fully as important. The
Company awoke to the fact that the Watson generator was overloaded,
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
and that it ought to get a new dynamo. Watson could still hold up
the engineering end perhaps, but we must have a business manager.
President Hubbard said he knew just the man for us&mdash;a thousand
horsepower steam engine wasting his abilities in the United States
Railway Mail Service, and he sent me down to Washington to investigate
and report.</p>
<p>I must have been impressed, for I telegraphed to Mr. Hubbard to
hire the man if he could raise money enough to pay his salary. He
did so. This was one of the best things I ever helped to do. When
the new manager came to work a short time later, he said to me:
&ldquo;Watson, I want my desk alongside of yours for a few months until
I learn the ropes.&rdquo; But the balance of the conceit that previous two
years had not knocked out of me vanished, when in about a fortnight,
I found he knew all I had learned, and that at the end of a month I
was toddling along in the rear trying to catch up, which I never did.
He has still quite an important position in the business. His name
is Theodore N. Vail. May his light never dim for many and many
a year!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<i>Editor&rsquo;s Note: Mr. Vail died Apr. 16, 1920.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c35">The Bell System</h3>
<p>The needs of the new business attracted other men with good ideas
who entered our service, such men as Emile Berliner and George L.
Anders and many others. Every agency became a center of inventive
activity, each with its special group of ingenious, thinking men&mdash;every
one of whom contributed something, and sometimes a great deal
to the improvement of apparatus or methods. I remember particularly
Ed. Gilliland, of Indianapolis, an ingenious man and excellent mechanic,
who improved the generator of my magneto call bell, shortening
the box and making it less funereal.</p>
<p>He did much also for central office switchboards.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the great wave of telephonic activity,
not only in electrical and mechanical invention, but also in business
and operative organization, which has been increasing in its force
ever since, to which men in this audience have made and are making
splendid contributions. To-day that wave has become a mighty flood
on which the great Bell system floats majestically as it moves ever
onward to new achievements.</p>
<h3 id="c36">Turning to Other Activities</h3>
<p>My connection with the telephone business ceased in 1881. The
strenuous years I had passed through had fixed in me a habit of not
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
sleeping nights as much as I should, and a doctor man told me I would
better go abroad for a year or two for a change. There was not the
least need of this, but as it coincided exactly with my desires, and as
the telephone business had become, I thought, merely a matter of
routine, with nothing more to do except pay dividends and fight infringers,
I resigned my position as General Inspector of the Company,
and went over the ocean for the first time.</p>
<p>When I returned to this country a year or so later, I found the
telephone business had not suffered in the least from my absence, but
there were so many better men doing the work that I had been doing,
that I didn&rsquo;t care to go into it again.</p>
<p>I was looking for more trouble in life and so I went into shipbuilding,
where I found all I needed.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Bell went to England on his bridal trip, we agreed that
as soon as the telephone became a matter of routine business he and
I would begin experimenting on flying machines, on which subject he
was full of ideas at that early time. I never carried out this agreement.
Bell did some notable work on airships later, but I turned my
attention to battleships.</p>
<h3 id="c37">My Greatest Pride</h3>
<p>Such is my very inadequate story of the earliest days of the telephone
so far as they made part of my life. To-day when I go into a
central office or talk over a long distance wire or read the annual
report of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, filled with
figures up in the millions and even billions, when I think of the growth
of the business, and the marvelous improvements that have been made
since the day I left it, thinking there was nothing more to do but
routine, I must say that all that early work I have told you about
seems to shrink into a very small measure, and, proud as I always
shall be, that I had the opportunity of doing some of that earliest work
myself, my greatest pride is that I am one of the great army of telephone
men, every one of whom has played his part in making the
Bell Telephone service what it is to-day.</p>
<p>I thank you.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
